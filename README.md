# Canon Password Manager
A simple password manager I built for personal usage! I plan to extend it's functionality as I need it!

PRs are open :)

### Requirements
* Java 17 ([Installation guide here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html))
* Maven ([Installation guide here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html))
* MongoDB ([Installation guide here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)) 
* NodeJS 16 ([This doesn't need a guide, come on](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

### Setting-up
After cloning the repository on your local, get into the ```canon-be``` directory on your terminal and write:
```
mvn clean install
```
This will install the required dependencies and set everything for you. Once this is done, you can open the project on your prefered IDE or code editor.
